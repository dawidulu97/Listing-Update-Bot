1. Comeplete logic to Monitor eBay Listings
Fetch Data: Write a script that uses eBay's API to fetch the latest listings from a specific seller.
Check for Updates: Implement logic to determine whether there are new or updated listings since the last check. This usually involves storing the last known state and comparing it with the current state.
Handle Errors: Ensure your script gracefully handles potential errors like network issues or changes in the eBay API.

2. Integrate Telegram Notifications
Telegram Bot: Create a Telegram bot using BotFather on Telegram. Store the bot token securely.
Send Messages: Use the Telegram Bot API to send messages. You can use Python libraries like python-telegram-bot for easier integration.
Format Notifications: Design how your notifications should look, including important details about the eBay listings.

3. Automate and Deploy
Automation: The script needs to run at regular intervals. This can be done using cron jobs (on Linux/Mac) or Task Scheduler (on Windows).
Deployment: Consider deploying your script on a cloud server (like AWS, Heroku, or a similar service) if you want it to run continuously and reliably.
